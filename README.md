# java-jop-ideas
Using panels, JOptionpane, and JComponent, this project's main goal is to create JOP-equivalent popup dialogs for various tasks.

1. Acceptance Criteria related to the JLogin portion of this project
	- We wish to securely have a password and username be verified against a database (text file for now) 
		using a datastructure that exists only as much as needed to verify the credentials (something like a JSession)
	- We want color customization (to look nice)
		- possible borders on the actual dialog box
		- background color
	- We want modularity
		- You know. 
	- Buttons
		- a login button on the right that is selected upon bootup
		- a cancel button to the left that is not selected upon bootup
	- Feedback to the user if credentials are invalid
	- Possibly restrict trials 
2. Acceptance Criteria related to the JTable section of this project
	- WIP
